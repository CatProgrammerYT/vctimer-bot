## Introduction
### Well... uhm... Hello there! This bot was created for my friend`s discord server but anyone can use it. This bot counts how much time user`ve spent in voice channels and gives
### role depending on time. Yea, that`s all for now :D
## Programming languages and stuff
### I`ve used discord.py library for launching bot and Python programming language to write backend for bot.
